# Each branches contain a solution to this exercise:
## KeyboardBroken
- Given what is supposed to be typed and what is actually typed, write a function that returns the broken key(s).
The function looks like: findBrokenKeys(correct phrase, what you actually typed)
**Notes**
1. Broken keys should be ordered by when they first appear in the sentence.
2. Only one broken key per letter should be listed.
3. Letters will all be in lower case.
